# Using weka for data mining

In this exercise where going to transform data that we collected from kaggle

![data from kaggle](kaggle_data.png)

we'll first convert it into a [.csv file](road_accident_dataset_1.csv)

After that we now have to make it weka friendly by changing the file extension to [.arff](accident.arff)

the file will look like this

![a sample of the file](arff_file.png)


 - load the dataset to the weka program

 - normalize the data to ensure that  the dataset has the same scale
